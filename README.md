# Building BMI Calculator using Python
This project aims to create a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using the formula: BMI (Metric Unit, SI) = Mass (kg) / Height^2 (m). The user will input their name, weight in kilograms, and height in meters. The program will calculate the BMI and classify the user's BMI into several categories.

## Resources
The BMI calculator uses the formula given above and the classification categories from Calculator.net.

## Usage
To use the BMI calculator, the user will input their name, weight in kilograms, and height in meters. The program will calculate their BMI and classify it into a category.

    Input your Name: Fathin Afif
    Enter you Weight in Kilograms (Kg): 66
    Enter you Height in Meter (M): 1.65
    Fathin Afif, Your BMI Score is: 24.242424242424246
    You Have Normal Weight, Good Job!.

## Classification

If the user's BMI falls into one of the categories below, the program will display a message with advice:

- Severe Thinness: < 16
- Moderate Thinness: 16 - 17
- Mild Thinness: 17 - 18.5
- Normal: 18.5 - 25
- Overweight: 25 - 30
- Obese Class I: 30 - 35
- Obese Class II: 35 - 40
- Obese Class III: > 40

## Conclusion
This project is a simple BMI calculator that can be used to quickly calculate and classify an individual's BMI. The program can also provide advice on how to improve their health if their BMI falls into one of the unhealthy categories.
